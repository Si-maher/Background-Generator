    <h1>Background Generator review</h1>
    <h3>The project</h3>
    <p>This project creates rgba colors and then changes the background of the body with the new selected colors. A gradient which flows to the right is also used.<br/>
        Technologies used are; <b>JavaScript, HTML and CSS</b>. Javascript is used to dynamically change the body into the new colors.
    </p>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>Firstly, a number of variables using <b>let</b> are declared and are connected to the <b>DOM</b> through <b>getElementbyId and byElement</b>. On the index.html these variables are connected to various elements. This allows Javascript to know what to search and render.<br/>

     </p>
        <p>A function is created that when called, will render  the background color. It targets the new color's rgba value and is set as the <b>CSS textContent</b>. </p>

        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <p>The main problem was due to me having class instead of <b>ID</b> inside the html form. This returned a value in the console of 'cannot read of undefined'. After some careful code view, this was observed and duly corrected.</p>
